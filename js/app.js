Shuffle function, courtesy of the Durstenfeld Shuffle (and later popularized by Donald Knuth).
Fisher-Yates created their algorithm in 1938 "as a method for researchers to mix stuff up with
pencil and paper," according to Frank Mitchell's blog at https://www.frankmitchell.org/2015/01/fisher-yates/.
Richard Durstenfeld adapted the Fisher-Yates shuffle in 1964, creating a more modern, computer-oriented algorithm.
Durstenfeld and Knuth only later acknowledged Fisher and Yates' contributions to the shuffle algorithm, although it's
unclear the former two knew of Fisher and Yates' work when the more modern version was first puplished and then popularized.

startTimer() is a simple clock started by the moveCounter() function. It's a rather inelegant

of 1000 milliseconds, after which the second variable increments. When second++ reaches 60,
minute is incremented and second is reset to zero. Additionally, a "tock" sound effect plays
during each interval. This was added to give a sense of "suspense" to the game. My wife thought
it was annoying, which is why I also added the volume slider (above). Not exactly an atomic
